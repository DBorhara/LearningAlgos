# Binary Search

Binary search is a much faster form of search than linear search

Rather than eliminate one element at a time, we eliminate half the remaining elements at a time.

Only works on sorted arrays!

It is a Divide and Conquer pattern

Use start, end and middle pointers

Best Case O(1)
Worst Case O(log n)
Average Case (log n)
