# Radix Sort

Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers
It never makes comparisons between elements
It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits
More digits means a bigger number

| Time Complexity(Best) | Time Complexity(Average) | Time Complexity(Worst) | Space Complexity |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| O(nk)                 | O(nk)                    | O(nk)                  | O(n+k)           |

n - length of array
k - number of digits(average)
