# Sorting

What is sorting?

The process of rearranging the items in a collection(e.g. an array) so that items are in some kind of order

Examples:

- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
- Sorting names alphabetically
- Sorting movies based on release year
- Sorting movies based on revenue

Why do we need to learn this?

Sorting is an incredibly common task, so its good to know how it works.
There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantage and disadvantages.

Big O of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity(Best) | Time Complexity(Average) | Time Complexity(Worst) | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)                  | O(n^2)                   | O(n^2)                 | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)                  | O(n^2)                   | O(n^2)                 | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n^2)                | O(n^2)                   | O(n^2)                 | O(1)             |

Recap

Sorting is fundamental
Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
All have average time complexities that are quadratic
We can do better... but we need more complex data
