# Selection Sort

Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places values into sorted position.

Find the minimum, swap at the end of the loop and put it at the beginning.

[5,3,4,1,2] >
[1,3,4,5,2] >
[1,2,3,4,5]

Best Case O(n^2)
Worst Case O(n^2)
Average Case (n^2)
