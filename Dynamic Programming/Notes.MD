# Dynamic Programming

### WTF is Dynamic Programming

A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing their solutions

## Overlapping Sub-Problems

A problem is said to have overlapping sub-problems if it can be broken down into sub-problems that can be reused several times

## Optimal Substructure

A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its sub-problems
