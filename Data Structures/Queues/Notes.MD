# Queues

What is a queue?

A FIFO(first in first out) data structure

Think of waiting in line

How do we use them in programming?

- Background tasks
- Uploading resources
- Print queue

Abstract Data Structure(ASD)

Big O of Stacks

- Insertion O(1)
- Removal O(1)
- Searching O(N)
- Access O(N)

## Recap

- Queues are a FIFO data structure, all elements are first in, first out
- Queues are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures
- Insertion and Removal can be done in O(1)
