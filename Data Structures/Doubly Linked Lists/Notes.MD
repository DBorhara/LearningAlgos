Big O of Double Linked Lists

Insertion - 0(1)
Removal - O(1)
Searching - O(N)
Access - O(N)
Technically searching is O(N/2) but that is still O(N).

## Recap

- Doubly linked lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
- Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time
- However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
